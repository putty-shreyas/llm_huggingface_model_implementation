## LLM HuggingFace Model Implementation:

The purpose of this python notebook is to showcase the ease with which Open-source LLM models from HuggingFace can be integrated into a colab notebook especially to do NLP tasks. By using the APIs of the HuggingFace models we don't really need to download and run the models in our local machine and get the functionality of a LLM model via the convenience of the online API. Thus this is the showcase of a LLM model utilization with low resources.

## Model Selection:
Mistral 7B Instruct v0.3 model was selected from the selection of open source models available at HuggingFace for a query answering task.

## Summary and Results:
- Implemented an Open-source LLM model from HuggingFace for query answering (text generation) use case.
- Used Mistral 7B Instruct v0.3 model from MistralAI by using it's API key from HuggingFace.
- Showcased the use of LangChain and Prompt Template to chain the LLM model and the prompt to get relevant generated text results as shown in the output cells.
- Generated text results showcased in the project, highlighting the ease with which Open-source LLM models can be implemented.
