## LLM HuggingFace Model Implementation:

The purpose of this python notebook is to showcase the ease with which Open-source LLM models from HuggingFace can be integrated into a colab notebook especially to do NLP tasks. By using the APIs of the HuggingFace models we don't really need to download and run the models in our local machine and get the functionality of a LLM model via the convenience of the online API. Thus this is the showcase of a LLM model utilization with low resources.

## Model Selection:
Mistral 7B Instruct v0.3 model was selected from the selection of open source models available at HuggingFace for a simple query answering task.

## Summary and Results:
- LLM model was loaded from the HuggingFace Endpoint and used in this implementation.
- Results for the query are shown in the output cells.
- Query Example 3 showcases the use of langchain and a prompt template to perfectly show the implementation of the LLM  and the prompt.
