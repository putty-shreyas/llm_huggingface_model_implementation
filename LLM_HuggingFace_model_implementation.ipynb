By using the APIs of the HuggingFace models we don't really need to download and run the models in our local machine and get the functionality of a LLM model via the convenience of the online API. Thus this is the showcase of a LLM model utilization with low resources."

            "Tides in the sea and oceans are primarily caused by the gravitational interactions between the Earth, Moon, and Sun. Here's a simplified explanation:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Gravitational Force: Both the Moon and the Sun exert gravitational forces on the Earth. The Moon's gravitational force is stronger because it's closer. However, the Sun's gravitational force is stronger overall because it's much more massive.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. Tidal Bulge: As the Earth rotates on its axis, it moves under both the Moon and the Sun, creating two tidal bulges. One bulge forms on the side of the Earth closest to the Moon (and Sun, to a lesser extent) and the other forms on the opposite side, known as the \"anti-tidal bulge.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "3. High and Low Tides: As the Earth rotates, different parts of the world experience high tide and low tide at different times. Areas facing the tidal bulge experience high tide, while areas facing the anti-tidal bulge experience low tide. This happens approximately every 12 hours and 25 minutes, which is the lunar day, or a lunar cycle.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. Spring Tides and Neap Tides: The difference between high and low tides varies throughout the month due to the alignment of the Sun, Earth, and Moon. When the Sun, Earth, and Moon are roughly in a straight line (first and third quarters of the Moon), we have spring tides, with larger differences between high and low tides. When the Sun and Moon are at right angles to each other (full Moon and new Moon), we have neap tides, with smaller differences between high and low tides.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. Resonance and Other Factors: Other factors such as the Earth's rotation, ocean basins, and resonance (where a small external force causes a system to oscillate at a higher frequency than the forcing frequency) also play a role in the formation of tides, but they are more complex and less intuitive.\n"
